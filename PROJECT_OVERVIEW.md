### Chart Implementation Details

The app uses **react-native-wagmi-charts**, a high-performance charting library built on React Native Reanimated 2:

- **PriceText & DatetimeText**: Real-time updating labels
- **Haptic Feedback**: Optional tactile feedback on touch (via expo-haptics)

#### Gesture System:
Using **react-native-gesture-handler** for native-driven touch interactions:
- **Simultaneous Gestures**: Pan and Pinch work together using `Gesture.Simultaneous()`
- **Pan Gesture**: 1-finger horizontal scrolling through data
  - `minPointers(1).maxPointers(1)` for single-finger constraint
  - Converts translation to data percentage for smooth scrolling
- **Pinch Gesture**: 2-finger zoom with focal point preservation
  - Real-time scale calculation from gesture center
  - Maintains zoom bounds (10%-100% of data visible)
- **Worklet Architecture**: All gesture calculations run on UI thread for 60fps performance
