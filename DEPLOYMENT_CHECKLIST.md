## Troubleshooting

### If stock prices don't load:
```bash
# Test Finnhub API in browser:
https://finnhub.io/api/v1/quote?symbol=AAPL&token=d3scib9r01qs1aps7j90d3scib9r01qs1aps7j9g
```
Should return JSON with price data.

### If charts don't load:
```bash
# Test Alpha Vantage API:
https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=GLOBAL_QUOTE&symbol=AAPL&apikey=TRMIRT3FUXJ03QAJ
```
Should return quote data. Charts will show mock data as fallback.

### If news doesn't load:
```bash
# Test Marketaux API:
https://api.marketaux.com/v1/news/all?symbols=AAPL&limit=1&api_token=PbUA2StPaFvBtpXBL3REgxfMVVozwaPkV9iv07r7
```
Should return news articles.

### If AI summary doesn't load:
- Check Perplexity API key is valid
- Verify you have Pro subscription
- Summary is cached for 24 hours after first load
- May take 5-10 seconds on first request

## Performance Tips

### If app is slow on Expo Snack:

1. **Reduce stock list** (temporary for testing):
   - Edit `data/sp100.json`
   - Keep only first 20 stocks
   - Remove rest

2. **Test on mobile device instead of web**:
   - Web preview can be slower
   - Install Expo Go on phone
   - Scan QR code for better performance

3. **Clear cache and restart**:
   - Close and reopen app
   - Pull to refresh

## File Locations

All files are in:
```
/Users/selim/Desktop/Portfolio_mgmt_project/
```

## Sharing Your App

Once working on Expo Snack:

1. Click **"Save"** button (top right)
2. Click **"Share"** button
3. You'll get a URL like: `https://snack.expo.dev/@yourname/stock-app`
4. Share this URL with anyone!

They can:
- View your code
- Run on their phone by scanning QR code
- Fork to create their own version

## Converting to Standalone App

To create a real app (later):

```bash
# Install EAS CLI
npm install -g eas-cli

# Login to Expo
eas login

# Configure build
eas build:configure

# Build for Android
eas build --platform android

# Build for iOS
eas build --platform ios
```
